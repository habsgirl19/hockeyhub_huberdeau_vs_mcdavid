Hockey is more than a complex team sport. The emergence of advanced statistics in the game over the previous decade has only raised the competition of young players to earn the prized top spot in the NHL draft and high-level management to scour across the NHL to fill position voids to earn a berth in the postseason and raise the Stanley Cup.

The postseason in 2022 brought an 31-year end to the Battle of Alberta - one of the NHL's admirable provincial rival between the Edmonton Oilers and the Calgary Flames. In June 2022, Jonathan Huberdeau, a powerful offensive figure, signed a long-term contract with Calgary. My interest sparked to undertake a project to study the offensive talent of generational player Connor McDavid and Huberdeau and project to a new era of the BOA.
